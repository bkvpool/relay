Docker compose file to manage relay node

## Intalling

- git clone to your linux home folder (if you select other folder, you have to change the script cnode.sh)
- add .env file from examples to the folder with docker compose file, change the paths if needed
- add path to $PATH variable in your favorite shell and reload the shell


if you did everything right, just write cnode.sh to see the help of command line script
